# Frontend of realtime betting demo

This is a Vue app that demonstrates how to drive a front end using server sent events for low latency use cases with Confluent Cloud.

The back end is being driven by the associated springboot app in this repo.

The front end shows the positions of the Formula One racers as the race conspires (i.e. the springboot app runs).
